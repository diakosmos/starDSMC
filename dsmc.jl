"""
This is a straight traslation of the dsmc programs from Alejandro Garcia's book.

He has two programs, "dsmceq" and "dsmcne", which have a lot of overlap. I'm beginning
with dsmcne.

Subtle tweaks:

The MATLAB version of his program 'dscmne' was actually several programs together:
    dsmcne.m ->
        sorter.m
        colider.m
        mover.m
        sampler.m

Here, I have bundled all of these together as Julia functions within a module,
the module being named "dsmc", intended to contain both "dsmcne" and "dsmceq".
