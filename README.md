# starDSMC
DSMC implemented for planetary rings etc.

Work-in-progress.

This code is very much in early development stages; however, you are welcome to use it as a starting point for your own DSMC work. The code is based loosely off the DSMC code by Alejandro Garcia in his excellent text, "Numerical Methods for Physics" (http://algarcia.org/nummeth/nummeth.html).

At this stage, there is no clear single "main" entry point into the code. Try rings2.jl.
